# project.greenfoot - Greenfoot project metadata (do not modify unless necessary)
# This file is used by Greenfoot to identify the project and resources.
# It should remain present in the project root so Greenfoot recognizes the scenario.
# Any edits here should be minimal and done via Greenfoot IDE where possible.
